# Running the iAuditor Extractor Tool

Each time you want to run the tool, you need to ensure you have used the `cd` command to move into the correct directory. If you're unsure how to do this, please refer to the 'Installing Requirements' section for guidance. If you've come to this page directly from the configuration stage, you should be ready to go.

For example, to export in CSV, you'd run:

1. On Windows, run: `python exporter.py --format csv`
1. On macOS, run: `python3 exporter.py --format csv`

For all the other formats available, check out [Export Options](../../script-running/export-options/).
