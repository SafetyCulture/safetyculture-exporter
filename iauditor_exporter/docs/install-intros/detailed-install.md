# Detailed Guidance

There are 4 steps to setting up this script:

* [Installing Python](../../Install-python/overview)
* [Downloading the Script](../../script-download/git/)
* [Installing the Scripts requirements](../../script-setup/installing-packages/)
* [Configuring the Script](../../script-setup/config/)

!!! Tip
    * At multiple points you'll be asked to "run" commands in a terminal or command prompt window. You'll know it's a command you need to run because it'll be formatted like this: 
        * `run me`
    * All you need to do is copy the suggested the command (just highlight them > right click > copy) and then paste them in. Once you've pasted in the command, you need to press Enter on your keyboard to submit the command.
    * If you receive any errors such as 'Command Not Found' or 'File Not Found' when running commands, go back through the guidance and ensure you're in the right folder.
