# Understanding the output from the iAuditor Exporter Tool

The iAuditor Exporter tool has been created to help make it easier to take the data given by our API and import it into BI tools such as PowerBI, Qlik and Tableau. 

The tool can currently export both inspection data and actions data into either CSV files or directly into a SQL database.
