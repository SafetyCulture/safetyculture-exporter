# CSV or SQL?

We would encourage the use of SQL if possible as it is more scalable as you grow, and refreshing the data from a database is much faster than one from CSV files. A SQL database is also able to offer other benefits such as the merging of duplicate entries which isn't possible with CSV. 

However, if you are a small organisation, or do not have access to a SQL database, CSV files offer the exact same data output.
