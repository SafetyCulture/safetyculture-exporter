# Install Python on Windows

1. Visit Python's Windows Releases Page: [https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
2. This page contains a lot of links, the section you need is on the left hand side titled "Stable Releases"
3. Under "Stable Releases" you'll see various download options. In 99% of cases you'll be able to use the one called `Windows x86-64 executable installer`

4. This will begin the download, once done open the file and click through the installer - the defaults are fine, feel free to keep clicking continue through them. 
5. On the final page before clicking 'Finish' there is a tick box that reads "Add to PATH" - ensure this is ticked. If you're reading this having already missed the tick box, simply re-run the installer and it'll ask again at the end. 
6. That's it! We can now move on to the script.
