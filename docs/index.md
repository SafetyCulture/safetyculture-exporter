# Overview
The iAuditor Exporter tool is the primary way to bulk export iAuditor information for use in BI tools such as PowerBI. The tool is coded in the Python programming language and can be ran simply and easily on any computer with Python installed.

We also have a Docker image available for those who'd prefer to deploy a container instead. 

This documentation aims to make it easy to not only set up the tool, but to also understand and make use of the data it gives out.
