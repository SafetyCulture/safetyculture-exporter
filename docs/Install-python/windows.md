## Install Python on Windows

1. The first thing you need is Python itself. Python is available in many different versions, ranging from version 2.7 all the way through to 3.8 at the time of writing. For our script, you'll need at least Python 3.6
2. Visit Python's Windows Releases Page: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
3. This page contains a lot of links, the section you need is on the left hand side titled "Stable Releases"
4. Under "Stable Releases" you'll see various download options. In 99% of cases you'll be able to use the one called "Windows x86-64 exectuable installer"
5. This will begin the download, once done open the file and click through the installer - the defaults are fine, feel free to keep clicking continue through them. 
6. On the final page before clicking 'Finish' there is a tick box that reads "Add to PATH" - ensure this is ticked. If you're reading this having already missed the tickbox, simply re-run the installer, and it'll ask again at the end. 
7. That's it! We can now move on to the script.
